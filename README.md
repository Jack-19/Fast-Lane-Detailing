# Fast Lane Detailing Website

Here is a link to the live website.
()

This website has been created as part of a Code Institute course. (diploma in software development)
This project is is my milestone one user centric frontend development.
My first project has been created to advertise a vehicle detailing company. (fast lane detailing)
The project has been mainly created using code supplied via bootstrap. This was done to ensure the project is
responsive and laid out clearly.

I have altered the layout for many sections using Bootstrap via custom CSS to tweak how things are displayed.

## Design

## Features
- Social links (used to retain potential customers,
  company updates via social media)

- Easy to navigate
- Responsive design on all devices
- Simple layout

## Structure

## Testing
- Devtools
I have carried out comprehensive testing of my project before deployment.
I firstly used dev tools to inspect the project, this enabled me to change devices and see how it would be displayed.
It also gave me the ability to move the screen display and check. (make the page wider/thinner taller/shorter)
- Devices
I then opened the project on as many devices as I could get my hands on just to double check display of the project on different devices.  
Devices Used:
- iphone 8
- iphone 11
- hp pavilion g series laptop
- hp laptop


## Built Width:
- Bootstrap 4 (v4)  
Used for initial layout before customizing to my exact needs requirements.
- Google Fonts  
Fonts imported to give the exact presentation required
- Font Awesome  
Used to import various icons throughout the project
- Git Hub  
Used for creating repository, storing code and deploying project.
- Git Pod  
Used to create code, edit code and version control.

## Problems Encountered:
I planned on having my service cards section displayed vertically 3 cards wide on desktop view and 1 card on mobile view.
I found difficulty creating a card layout that was responsive how I planned. I overcome this problem via placing the cards code 
inside a Bootstrap col/row code section. Thid created a responsive display for the service card section.
