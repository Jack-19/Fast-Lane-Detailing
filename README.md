# milestoneproject-car
My first project has been created to advertise a vehicle detailing company. (fast lnae detailing)
The project has been mainly created using code supplied via bootstrap. This was done to ensure the project is
responsive and laid out clearly. This project was created as part of a Code Institute course. 

I have altered the layout for many sections using Bootstrap via custom CSS to tweak how things are displayed.

Built Width:
.Bootstrap 4
.HTML
.CSS
.Google Fonts
.Font Awesome
.Git Hub
.Git Pod

Problems Encountered:
I planned on having my service cards section displayed vertically 3 cards wide on desktop view and 1 card on mobile view.
I found difficulty creating a card layout that was responsive how I planned. I overcome this problem via placing the cards code 
inside a Bootstrap col/row code section. Thid created a responsive display for the service card section.
